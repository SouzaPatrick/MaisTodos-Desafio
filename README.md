- [x] Function to validate CPF
- [x] [Validate input data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_GQdxRSnIg)
- [x] Perform the sum of received values and check if they are the same as the total coming in the payload
  - I validated taking into account that the value is being sent and this was a requirement at the time of project construction. Particularly, I wouldn't even return an error, I would just add the products at this moment and pass the sum value forward to avoid a bottleneck, as it is a challenge, I just validated it and returned the error.
